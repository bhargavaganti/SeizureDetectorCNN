# SeizureDetectorCNN
This is project aimed at taking EEG (10-20 lead system external EEGs) recording from patients that presnted in the clinical with intractable seizures. The goal is to utilize machine learning to automatically detect serizure onset online.

Spatial Interpolation of the EEG data to an image representation is done utilzing Matlab. (Can work on converting this to python for opensource purposes). 

Machine Learning is utilized on the image representations of the EEG data set utilizing Tensorflow (python) for Seizure detection.
